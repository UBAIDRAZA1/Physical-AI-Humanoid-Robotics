# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Introduction

Simulation is crucial for developing and testing robotic systems before deploying them in the real world. This module introduces you to Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Create and modify URDF/SDF robot models
- Simulate physics, gravity, and collisions
- Use Unity for high-fidelity robot visualization
- Simulate sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs

## Why Simulation?

- **Safety**: Test dangerous scenarios without risk
- **Cost-Effective**: No need for expensive hardware during development
- **Reproducibility**: Repeat experiments with exact conditions
- **Speed**: Run simulations faster than real-time

## Module Structure

1. **Gazebo Basics** - Environment setup and configuration
2. **URDF and SDF** - Robot description formats
3. **Physics Simulation** - Gravity, collisions, and dynamics
4. **Sensor Simulation** - LiDAR, cameras, IMUs
5. **Unity Integration** - High-fidelity rendering

Let's start with Gazebo!
