# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Introduction

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) serves as the middleware that connects all components of a robotic system. Think of it as the nervous system of a robot—it enables communication between sensors, actuators, and AI agents.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
- Create ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
- Bridge Python AI agents to ROS 2 controllers using rclpy
- Work with URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoid robots
- Build and deploy ROS 2 packages

## Why ROS 2?

ROS 2 provides:

- **Distributed Architecture**: Components can run on different machines
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Better performance for time-critical operations
- **Language Support**: Python, C++, and other languages
- **Industry Standard**: Used by major robotics companies worldwide
- **Open Source**: Free and actively maintained

## Module Structure

This module covers:

1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Core concepts and architecture
2. **Nodes, Topics, and Services** - Communication patterns
3. **Python Integration with rclpy** - Connecting AI agents
4. **URDF for Humanoids** - Robot description and modeling
5. **Building ROS 2 Packages** - Creating reusable components

Let's begin with the fundamentals!
