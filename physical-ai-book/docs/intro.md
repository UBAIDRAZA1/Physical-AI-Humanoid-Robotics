# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **AI-native textbook** for the *Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics* course. This book blends theory, labs, and assessments with a built-in RAG chatbot, personalization, login via Better-Auth, and one-tap Roman Urdu translation.

## What you will build

- A complete quarter-long pathway that bridges digital brains (LLMs, VLA) to physical bodies (ROS 2 humanoids, Gazebo/Isaac digital twins).
- Capstone: a simulated humanoid that hears a voice command, plans with LLMs, navigates with Nav2/VSLAM, perceives with Isaac, and manipulates an object.
- Cloud and on-prem lab patterns so students can work with either RTX rigs or cloud GPUs plus Jetson edge kits.

## Interactive features baked into the book

- **RAG Chatbot**: Ask any question from the textbook or select text to ground the answer. Powered by OpenAI + Qdrant + Neon Postgres via the included FastAPI backend.
- **Login & Profile (Better-Auth)**: Sign up, capture hardware/software background, and sync learning state.
- **Personalize Chapter Content**: A per-chapter button tailors explanations and lab hints to your profile.
- **Roman Urdu Toggle**: Switch chapter text and chatbot responses to Roman Urdu instantly.

## Course map (13 weeks)

1. Foundations of Physical AI and sensors
2-5. ROS 2: nodes, topics/services, launches, URDF for humanoids

## How to use this book

- Start at `Plan` for the build roadmap and architecture.
- Follow `Quickstart` to run the FastAPI backend, Qdrant/Neon services, and the Docusaurus frontend locally.
- Use the **Chatbot** widget (book sidebar) to stay grounded in the current page.
- Press **Personalize** or **Urdu** at the top of any chapter once logged in.
